			  We first show the insignificant impact of aging on data integrity of FPGAs, i.e., Static Noise Margin (SNM) and Soft Error Rate (SER) of the configuration cells, as well as we show the negligible impact of the mentioned degradations on the FPGA performance.
			  As such, we focus on performance degradation of datapath transistors.
			  In this regard, we propose a routing accompanied by a placement algorithm that prevent constant stress on transistors by evenly distributing the stress through the interconnection resources.
			  By observing the impact of the signal probability on the aging of routing buffers, we enhance the synthesis flow as well as augment the proposed routing algorithm to converge the signal probabilities towards aging-friendly values.
			  Experimental results over a set of industrial benchmarks and commercial-like FPGA architecture indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method with 64.3% reduction of stress duration in multiplexers and up to 45.2% improvement of the degradation of buffers.
			  Altogether, the proposed method reduces the timing guardband by from 14.1% to 31.7%, depending on the FPGA routing architecture.</p></div></div></li>

			  This ever-increasing static power consumption acts as a power wall to further integration of transistors and has caused the breakdown of Dennard scaling.
			  To meet the available power budget and preclude reliability challenges associated with high power density, designers are obligated to restrict the active percentage of the chip by powering off a selective fraction of silicon die, referred to as Dark Silicon.
			  Several promising architectures have been proposed to enhance the static power and energy efficiency in FPGAs.
			  The main approach in the majority of suggested architectures includes applying power gating to unused logic and routing resources and/or designing power-efficient logic and routing elements such as Reconfigurable Hard Logics as an alternative for conventional Look-up Tables.
			  This study represents a survey on evolution of SRAM-based FPGA architectures toward the era of dark silicon.</p></div></div></li>

              <div class="dropdown"><div>Abstract </div><div class="dropdown-content"><p>The maximum delay of a processor is subject to both temperature (T) and voltage (V) jointly.
				Therefore, there is the prospect of reducing V at runtime whenever T is below the worst-case temperature without violating the predetermined timing constraints, instead of employing throughout a conservative V that corresponds to Tworst.
				Hence, the efficiency can be maximized, while still accounting for temperature variation at runtime, without sacrificing reliability.
				In this work, we focus on the key challenge of how the small, yet sufficient voltage can be accurately, at design time, obtained in which timing constraints at runtime are assuredly fulfilled.
				To achieve that, we model the delay of processor under the joint effects of T and V through creating cell libraries that contain the detailed delay information of cells at a wide variety of T and V cases.
				Libraries are compatible with commercial EDA tools.
				Hence, standard tool flows, even though they were not designed for that purpose, can be employed to seamlessly obtain the correlation between T and V in any circuit regardless its complexity.
				After modeling of the correlation between T and V from the physical level to circuit level, we implement at the system level a temperature-guided voltage adaptation technique that tunes the voltage at runtime following temperature variations leading to a considerable reduction in power.</p></div></div></li>

              <div class="dropdown"><div>Abstract </div><div class="dropdown-content"><p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a frontier in deep learning.
				GANs consist of two models: generative and discriminative.
				While the discriminative model uses the conventional convolution, the generative model depends on a fundamentally different operator, called transposed convolution.
				This operator initially inserts a large number of zeros in its input and then slides a window over this expanded input.
				This zero-insertion step leads to a large number of ineffectual operations and creates distinct patterns of computation across the sliding windows.
				The ineffectual operations along with the variation in computation patterns lead to significant resource underutilization when using conventional convolution hardware.
				To alleviate these sources of inefficiency, this paper devises FlexiGAN, an end-to-end solution, that generates an optimized synthesizable FPGA accelerator from a high-level GAN specification.
				FlexiGAN is coupled with a novel template architecture that aims to harness the benefits of both MIMD and SIMD execution models to avoid ineffectual operations.
				To this end, the proposed architecture separates data retrieval and data processing units at the finest granularity of each compute engine.
				Leveraging this separation enables the architecture to use a succinct set of operations to cope with the irregularities of transposed convolution.
				At the same time, it significantly reduces the on-chip memory usage, which is generally limited in FPGAs.
				We evaluate our end-to-end solution by generating FPGA accelerators for a variety of GANs.
				These generated accelerators provide 2.4× higher performance than an optimized conventional convolution design.
				In addition, FlexiGAN, on average, yields 2.8× (up to 3.7×) improvements in Performance-per-Watt over a Titan X GPU.</p></div></div></li>

				To achieve true autonomy, robots need to continuously process and interact with their environment through computationally-intensive motion planning and control algorithms under a low power budget.
				Specialized architectures offer a potent choice to provide low-power, high-performance accelerators for these algorithms.
				Instead of taking a traditional route which profiles and maps hot code regions to accelerators, this paper delves into the algorithmic characteristics of the application domain.
				We observe that many motion planning and control algorithms are formulated as a constrained optimization problems solved online through Model Predictive Control (MPC).
				While models and objective functions differ between robotic systems and tasks, the structure of the optimization problem and solver remain fixed.
				Using this theoretical insight, we create RoboX, an end-to-end solution which exposes a high-level domain-specific language to roboticists.
				This interface allows roboticists to express the physics of the robot and its task in a form close to its concise mathematical expressions.
				The RoboX backend then automatically maps this high-level specification to a novel programmable architecture, which harbors a programmable memory access engine and compute-enabled interconnects.
				Hops in the interconnect are augmented with simple functional units that either operate on in-fight data or are bypassed according a micro-program.
				Evaluations with six different robotic systems and tasks show that RoboX provides a 29.4× (7.3×) speedup and 22.1× (79.4×) performance-per-watt improvement over an ARM Cortex A57 (Intel Xeon E3).
				Compared to GPUs, RoboX attains 7.8×, 65.5×, and 71.8× higher Performance-per-Watt to Tegra X2, GTX 650 Ti, and Tesla K40 with a power envelope of only 3.4 Watts at 45 nm.</p></div></div></li>

			  By providing prominent features such as variant peripheral support and flexibility to partial or major design modifications, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are commonly used to implement either an entire embedded system or a Hardware Description Language (HDL)-based processor, known as soft-core processor.
			  FPGA-based designs, however, suffer from high power consumption, large die area, and low performance that hinders common use of soft-core processors in low-power embedded systems.
			  In this paper, we present an efficient reconfigurable architecture to implement soft-core embedded processors in SRAM-based FPGAs by using characteristics such as low utilization and fragmented accessibility of comprising units.
			  To this end, we integrate the low utilized functional units into efficiently designed Look-Up Table (LUT) based Reconfigurable Units (RUs).
			  To further improve the efficiency of the proposed architecture, we used a set of efficient Configurable Hard Logics (CHLs) that implement frequent Boolean functions while the other functions will still be employed by LUTs.
			  We have evaluated effectiveness of the proposed architecture by implementing the Berkeley RISC-V processor and running MiBench benchmarks.
			  We have also examined the applicability of the proposed architecture on an alternative open-source processor (i.e., LEON2) and a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) core.
			  Experimental results show that the proposed architecture as compared to the conventional LUT-based soft-core processors improves area footprint, static power, energy consumption, and total execution time by 30.7%, 32.5%, 36.9%, and 6.3%, respectively.</p></div></div></li>

			  In this paper, we present a Resistive Random Access Memory RRAM-based FPGA architecture employing efficient Switch Box (SB) and Look-Up Table (LUT) designs with programming circuitry integrated in both SB and LUT designs that creates area and power efficient programmable components while precluding performance overhead to these blocks.

			  By contrast, the goal of this work is to completely remove guardbands through exploring, for the first time, application of approximate computing principles in the context of aging.
			  As a result of naively narrowing or removing guardbands, timing errors start to appear as transistors age.
			  We demonstrate that even in circuits that may tolerate errors, aging can be catastrophic due to unacceptable quality loss.
			  Furthermore, quantifying such aging-induced quality loss necessitates expensive (often infeasible) gate-level simulations of the complete design.
			  We show how nondeterministic aginginduced timing errors can be converted into deterministic and controlled approximations instead.
			  We first translate the required guardband over time into an equivalent reduction in precision for individual RTL components.
			  We then demonstrate how, based on pre-characterization of RTL components, we can quantify aging-induced approximation at the whole microarchitecture level without the need for further gate-level simulations.
			  Results show that a 3 bit reduction in precision is sufficient to sustain 10 years of operation under worst-case aging in the context of an image processing circuit.

			  These libraries include detailed delay information of gates/cells under the impact that aging has on both threshold voltage (Vth) and carrier mobility (μ) of transistors.
			  This is unlike state of the art which considers V th only. We show how ignoring ß degradation leads to underestimating guard-bands by 19% on average.

			  Neglecting this fact results in employing insufficient guard-bands and thus not sustaining reliability during lifetime. We demonstrate that degradation-aware libraries and tool flows are indispensable for not only accurately estimating guardbands, but also efficiently containing them.
			  By considering aging degradations during logic synthesis, significantly more resilient circuits can be obtained. We further quantify the impact of aging on the degradation of image processing circuits.
			  This goes far beyond investigating aging with respect to path delays solely. We show that in a standard design without any guardbanding, aging leads to unacceptable image quality after just one year.
			  By contrast, if the synthesis tool is provided with the degradation-aware cell library, high image quality is sustained for 10 years (even under worst-case aging and without a guardband).

              <div class="dropdown"><div>Abstract </div><div class="dropdown-content"><p>With the continual scaling of feature size, system failure due to soft errors is getting more frequent in CMOS technology.
			  Soft errors have particularly severe effects in static random-access memory (SRAM)-based reconfigurable devices (SRDs) since an error in SRD configuration bits can permanently change the functionality of the system.
			  Since interconnect resources are the dominant contributor to the overall configuration memory upsets in SRD-based designs, the system failure rate can be significantly reduced by mitigating soft errors in routing fabric.
			  This paper first presents a comprehensive analysis of SRD switch box susceptibility to short and open faults. Based on this analysis, we present a dependable routing fabric by efficiently employing asymmetric SRAM cells in configuration memory of SRDs.
			  The proposed scheme is highly scalable and capable of achieving any desired level of dependability. In the proposed scheme, we also present a fault masking mechanism to mitigate the effect of soft errors in the routing circuitry.
			  A routing algorithm is also proposed to take the advantage of the proposed routing fabric.
			  Experimental results over the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina benchmarks show that the proposed scheme can mitigate both single and multiple event upsets in the routing fabric and can reduce system failure rate orders of magnitude as compared with the conventional protection techniques.</p></div></div></li>

              <div class="dropdown"><div>Abstract </div><div class="dropdown-content"><p>Hardware trojan horses (HTH) have recently emerged as a major security threat for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
			  Previous studies to protect FPGAs against HTHs may still leave a considerable amount of logic resources to be misused by malicious attacks.
			  This letter presents a low-level HTH protection scheme for FPGAs by filling the unused resources with the proposed dummy logic.
			  In the proposed scheme, we identify the unused resources at the device layout-level and offer dummy logic cells for different resources.
			  The proposed HTH protection scheme has been applied on Xilinx Virtex devices implementing a set of IWLS benchmarks.
			  The results show that by employing the proposed HTH protection scheme, the chance of logic abuse can be significantly reduced.
			  Experimental results also show that as compared to nonprotected designs, the proposed HTH scheme imposes no performance and power penalties.</p></div></div></li>

              <div class="dropdown"><div>Abstract </div><div class="dropdown-content"><p>While the transistor density continues to grow exponentially in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), the increased leakage current of CMOS transistors act as a power wall for the aggressive integration of transistors in a single die.
			  One recently trend to alleviate the power wall in FPGAs is to turn off inactive regions of the silicon die, referred to as dark silicon.
			  This paper presents a reconfigurable architecture to enable effective fine-grained power gating of unused Logic Blocks (LBs) in FPGAs.
			  In the proposed architecture, the traditional soft logic is replaced with Mega Cells (MCs), each consists of a set of complementary Generic Reconfigurable Hard Logic (GRHL) and a conventional Look-Up Table (LUT).
			  Both GRHL cells and LUTs can be power gated and turned off by controlling configuration bits. In the proposed MC, only one cell is active and the others are turned off.
			  Experimental results on MCNC benchmark suite reveal that the proposed architecture reduces the critical path delay, power, and Power Delay Product (PDP) of LBs up to 5.3%, 30.4%, and 28.8% as compared to the equivalent LUT-based architecture.</p></div></div></li>

              <div class="dropdown"><div>Abstract </div><div class="dropdown-content"><p>Promising advantages offered by resistive NonVolatile Memories (NVMs) have brought great attention to replace existing volatile memory technologies.
			  While NVMs were primarily studied to be used in the memory hierarchy, they can also provide benefits in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).
			  One major limitation of employing NVMs in FPGAs is significant power and area overheads imposed by the Peripheral Circuitry (PC) of NVM configuration bits.
			  In this paper, we investigate the applicability of different NVM technologies for configuration bits of FPGAs and propose a power-efficient reconfigurable architecture based on Phase Change Memory (PCM).
			  The proposed PCM-based architecture has been evaluated using different technology nodes and it is compared to the SRAM-based FPGA architecture.
			  Power and Power Delay Product (PDP) estimations of the proposed architecture show up to 37.7% and 35.7% improvements over SRAM-based FPGAs, respectively, with less than 3.2% performance overhead.</p></div></div></li>
