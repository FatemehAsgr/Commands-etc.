        <h1>Hossein Asadi</h1>
        <p class="lead">Hossein Asadi is a tenured associate professor in Department of Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology (SUT). He joined SUT in March 2009. He is the founder and the director of "Data Storage, Networks, and Processing" (DSN) lab, where he is supervising more than 15+ graduate and undergrad students in the field of "Data Storage Systems" and "Data Processing and Reconfigurable Computing". The DSN lab is known as one of the premier and leading research institutes in the World in the field of data storage systems. Since 2009, he has developed two new graduate courses ("Advanced Storage Systems" and "Reconfigurable Computing") in Department of Computer Engineering of Sharif University of Technology (SUT).

In 2011, he was awarded a Distinguished Lecturer Award by SUT. He got tenured and then was elevated to associate rank at SUT in Jan. 2013 and Oct. 2014, respectively. In 2105, he co-founded the first company in the Middle East, High-Performance Data Storage & Processing (HPDS) Corp, designing and fabricating midrange (SAB-SE), All Flash (SAB-ALL-Flash), and high-end data storage systems (SAB-MX). The first products of this company, namely RapidStore and SAB-SE Series, are released in Inotex 2015. In 2016, he received two prestigious awards by SUT, "Distinguished Researcher Award" and "Distinguished Research Institute Award". More recently, he received "Distinguished Technology Award" by SUT in 2017. Prior joining to SUT, he was with EMC Corporation, headquartered in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. He worked at EMC as a research scientist and senior hardware engineer from 2006 to 2009. In 2008, he was granted "Extraordinary ability in Science" (O1) visa by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, sponsored by EMC Corporation. He was also a recipient of the Technical Award for the Best Robot Design from the International RoboCup Rescue Competition, organized by AAAI and RoboCup and a recipient of Best Paper Award at the 15th CSI International Symposium on Computer Architecture and Digital Systems (CADS) in 2010.

His field of expertise is data storage systems and networks, solid-state drives, and reconfigurable and dependable computing. He has authored or co-authored more than seventy publications in reputed journals and conference proceedings. He has served as the publication chair of several conferences during the past three years. He has also served as a Guest Editor of IEEE Transactions on Computers, an Associate Editor of Microelectronics Reliability, and as a Program Co-Chair of the 18th International Symposium on Computer Architecture & Digital Systems (CADS2015). More recently, he was visiting the School of Computer and Communication Sciences of Ecole Polytechnique Federele de Lausanne (EPFL) as an invited professor for the summer 2015. He is a member of ACM and a senior member of IEEE.</p>
